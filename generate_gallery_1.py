"""The python/jinja2 code you wrote here earlier worked great. Can you add some 
CSS or JS code that when one hovers over each image, a transparent label 
covers the image to show the caption of the image. I will provide a list 
with the caption names and image file names. Also, use the caption names 
for the alt attribute."""
